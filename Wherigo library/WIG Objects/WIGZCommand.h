        True if you can choose a target for this command, false if the command script is started right away.

        Whether the user can see (and invoke) the command.

        Text that is displayed when the command is intended to be used with a target (CmdWith is true), but no suitable targets are visible.
 MakeReciprocal     Boolean.
        Only applies when CmdWith is true. When true, this command is automatically listed not only on the item/character where it's defined, but also on all items/characters that can be its targets. There it is listed as ZReciprocalCommand. (This is the default.) When false, the command is only listed on the item/character where it's defined.

        Whether every object is a target for this command. Only applies when CmdWith is true.
